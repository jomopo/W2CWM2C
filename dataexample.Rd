\description{
The data set \emph{dataexample} contains seven European stock market 
indexes (daily closing prices): FTSE MIB30 (Italy), IBEX35 (Spain), 
DAX30 (Germany), CAC40 (France), AEX25 (Netherlands), ATX20 (Austria) 
and NBEL20 (Belgium) spanning from January 2, 2004 to June 29, 2012. 
In order to cope with the different official holidays, we have adjusted 
the raw indices data, carrying forward the closing price from the last 
working day before each of these holidays.
